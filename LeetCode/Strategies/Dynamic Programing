7 Steps to solve a DP problem:
==============================
1. How to recognize a DP problem
2. Identify the problem variable
3. Clearly express the recurrence relation
4. Identify the base cases
5. Decide if you want to implement it iteratively or recursively
6. Add memoization
7. Determine time complexity

Step 1: How to recognize a Dynamic Programming problem
======================================================
-> What you want to ask yourself is whether your problem solution can be expressed as a function of solutions to similar smaller problems.
